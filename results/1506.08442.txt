Abstract

The quark production in classical color fields is investigated with a focus on the

induction of

an electromagnetic current by produced quarks. We show that the color

SU(2) and the SU(3) theories lead significantly different results for the electromag-
netic current. In uniform SU(2) color fields, the net electromagnetic current is not

generated, w.

hile in SU(3) color fields the net current is induced depending on the color

direction of backgro

und fields. Also the numerical study of the quark production in

inhomogeneous color fields is done. Motivated by gauge field configurations provided
by the color glass condensate framework, we introduce an ensemble of randomly dis-
tributed color electric fluxtubes. The spectrum of photons emitted from the quarks

calculations based on a first principle is needed. The purpose of the present study is to
ake a first step toward this direction.

In order to investigate the photon production in the Glasma (the central rapidity
region of nucleus-nucleus collisions), we need to first compute quark production because
he initial states described by the color glass condensate (see e.g. [18] [20]) purely
consist of gluons, which do not directly couple to photons. This situation is in contrast
o proton-nucleus collisions, where the proton can be viewed as high-energy partons, not
as classical gauge fields. The photon and dilepton production in proton-nucleus collisions
have been investigated by calculating the processes that a quark in the proton emits a
photon due to the interaction with strong color classical fields of the nucleus (23) [24].
In the leading order description of the color glass condensate and the Glasma, gauge
fields are treated as classical fields because the coupling is small, g < 1, and the fields
are strong, A ~ 1/g (see e.g. [25]). The quark dynamics in the leading order is described
oy retarded solutions of the Dirac equation under the classical gauge field. For generic
inhomogeneous gauge fields, we need to resort to lattice-discretized numerical calculations
o solve the Dirac equation. In studies of real-time dynamics of fermions on lattice,
here have been considerable advances [26} [271 [28] [29] [30]. Given these advances, we
will give a first-principle description of the quark dynamics under classical gauge fields,
and investigate the induction of electromagnetic (EM) current accompanying the quark
production. In this paper, we assume a system in a fixed box, namely boost-invariant
expansion is not taken into account. Besides we focus on only the one-point expectation
value of the EM current operator. From the expectation of the current, the spectrum of
photons produced by a classical process can be computed.

In the context of real-time lattice simulations of the early-time dynamics in heavy-ion
collisions, the color SU(2) theory is often used instead of the color SU(3) just for simplicity,
and it is sometimes expected that SU(3), results would be similar to SU(2)¢. Indeed, it has
shown that the dynamics of classical gauge fields exhibits no qualitative difference between
SU(2), and SU(3), [31]. We will show that, however, this is not the case for the induction
of EM currents. In SU(2)-, there is a tendency that two color components contribute to
the EM current with opposite signs to each other. We will show that this cancellation
is exact in uniform fields. On the other hand, in SU(3)., the degree of the cancellation
between different color components depends on the color direction of background fields.
Thus, the EM current can be several orders larger than that in SU(2)<.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The induction of EM currents by
uniform color electric fields is discussed in Sec. We compare lattice numerical results
with known analytic solutions to show the validity of our numerical method. In Sec.
we investigate the quark production and the subsequent induction of EM currents in
inhomogeneous background fields, whose configuration mimics the Glasma. The photon
spectrum associated with a classical emission process is shown at the last. Section [4] is
devoted to summary and discussions. The lattice numerical method we employ is explained
in the Appendix. In particular, our method to treat doubler modes is described in detail.

2 Uniform color electric fields

In this section, we investigate the induction of EM currents in uniform color electric
fields. Such a simple configuration for color fields enables us to do analytical studies
on real-time dynamics of quark production via the Schwinger mechanism [32] [33], and
thus clarifies the difference between SU(2) and SU(3) color fields for the induction of
EM currents. Therefore, studying the uniform color field configurations can provide us


with useful information to understand more complicated and realistic situation, which is
discussed in the next section.

Furthermore, the uniform field configurations can be used as a benchmark test for the
real-time lattice numerical computations. By comparing numerical results with known
analytic results, we can check the validity of our numerical method on lattice before
applying it to field configurations that analytical solutions are not available. See Appendix
[A] for details of the lattice numerical method.

In this paper, we consider only one family of quark flavor which has an EM charge
e and mass m, for simplicity. We will briefly comment on the effects of multi-flavors in

Sec.

2.1 Abelianization

We briefly review a method to simplify the color structure of the Dirac equation under
uniform color electromagnetic fields [33] [34]. Thanks to this simplification, the induction
of EM currents in uniform color fields can be understood intuitively.
If the field strength is spatially uniform, its color dependence can be factorized as
Fv = Fun" , (1)
where n® is a constant vector in color space. This kind of fields are called covariant
constant fields [35] [36]. This field strength is given by the gauge field

Aj (a) = Ap(x)n*, (2)

where A,,(z) is related with Fy by Fuv = 0,Av—O,Ay,. The gauge field is a solution of
the Yang-Mills equation. Because the color vector n* is constant, the structure of the co-
variant derivative D,, = 0,,—igA,,(z)n"T* can be reduced from SU(N,) to [U(1)]**. Since
n°T® is an Ne x Ne hermitian matrix, one can diagonalize it by a unitary transformation
as

Un®T°U! = diag (w1,--- ,wn,)- (3)

The color-rotated quark field vi = (Uw); (i= 1,--- , Nc) obeys
[i (On — iwigAy) — m] 4; = 0, (4)

which has the same structure as the U(1) theory but a coupling e is replaced by the
effective coupling wyg.

The SU(2) color space is isotropic since the rank of SU(2) is one. For any unit color
vector n*, the color matrix n°T“ takes the same form after diagonalization:

. . 1 1
Un®T*U! = diag (3 -5) . (5)
2° 2
Therefore, the effective couplings are always +g/2 and —g/2.

For N, > 3, the color space is anisotropic in a sense that the effective couplings depend
on the direction of the color vector n* in a gauge-invariant way. For SU(3)<, there are two
independent diagonal generators. If we take the generators T® = zat with the Gell-Mann
matrix \*, the diagonal generators are T? and T8, by which the diagonalized color matrix

n°T® can be expanded:

Un°TUt = T? cos6 — T® sin 8. (6)


The angle @ is related with the color vector n* through the second Casimir invariant
2
Cy = [dntn?n®| as
sin? 30 = 3C). (7)
By this equation, the angle 0 characterizes the color direction of the vector n® in a gauge-
invariant way. The eigenvalues of the matrix n°T“ are parametrized by @ as

w= ae os (6 + a)

Unlike the SU(2). case, these effective couplings have the color direction dependence.

2.2 EM currents in uniform color electric fields

Having discussed the diagonalization (Abelianization) of the color matrix, one can easily
prove the cancellation of EM currents in SU(2)- uniform electric fields (see Fig. [I). Let
us suppose that the electric field is applied to the z-direction with the strength Ep (> 0).
In the case of SU(2)¢, the effective couplings are independent of the color direction of the
gauge field. A quark with color 1 couples to the electric field with the effective coupling
of +39, and it also has an EM charge +e (we assume e > 0). This quark is accelerated
to the +z-direction by the electric field and causes a positive EM current. An anti-quark
is accelerated to the opposite direction but it has a negative EM charge, so that it also
induces a positive EM current. On the other hand, a quark with color 2 has the effective
coupling —49. Therefore, this quark is accelerated to —z-direction. Although the color
charges are opposite in sign between color 1 and 2, the EM charge is independent of the
color components. Consequently, the quark with color 2 induces a negative current, which
cancels the current induced by the quark with color 1. The same cancellation happens for
anti-quarks. In this way, we can conclude that uniform SU(2) color electric fields do not
induce an EM current.

Clearly, this argument does not apply to the SU(3)- case. Although there is alway a
tendency of the cancellation among different color components, the cancellation may not
be perfect. When @ = 0 (modulo 7/3), SU(3). is reduced to SU(2). because one of three
quarks decouples from the color field. For other values of the color angle 6, a nonzero EM
current is induced as we will show explicitly in the next subsection.

2.3 Numerical results

In the following we consider a uniform color electric field turned on at t = 0:

This field configuration is a solution of the Yang-Mills equation coupled to a pulse-like
external current

ait — — Fynd"36(t) . (10)

In Fig. the expectation value of the EM currents obtained by lattice numerical
calculations are plotted for some different values of the color angle @ in the case of SU(3)¢.
Only the z-component of the current is shown because the x- and y-components are zero
oy the symmetry of the system. When @ = 0, the EM current is indeed zero because
SU(3). is reduced to SU(2)-. For other values of 6, a nonzero EM current is generated
and its magnitude largely depends on the value of 6. This strong dependence of the EM
current on the color angle 6 stands in contrast to the weak dependence on @ that the the
otal quark number density shows [37] [33]. This result indicates that EM observables may
ye more sensitive to color field configurations than hadronic observables.

The linear increase of the EM current seen in Fig. |2/ and its dependence on @ can
ye understood from analytical results. Thanks to the Abelianization, the Dirac equation
under the uniform electric field can be analytically solved, and the distribution function
of produced quarks is available in a closed form [33]. Although the distribution function
has a complicated expression in terms of special functions, its behavior is well described
oy the following simple function [32]:

The expectation value of the EM current can be expressed by the analytic expressions for
the mode functions. However, it still contains the integration over momentum, which needs
to be evaluated numerically, making the parametric dependence on the color angle hardly
accessible. Instead of doing the numerical integration, we use the simple expression to
evaluate the EM current, and compare it with the results of lattice numerical calculations.
In terms of the distribution function, the EM current can be expressed as

Tis (t = 2D | aa = P eo Felts Pp). (13)

This is called conduction current, which is caused by movement of charged particles. In
addition to the conduction current, there is another contribution to the current, called
polarization current, which cannot be expressed by the normal distribution function. Ex-
cept the times right after the turning-on of the electric field, the polarization current is
negligible compared with the conduction current under a strong field, gE >> m? [32]. We
therefore consider only the conduction current. If we substitute Eq. into Eq. (13),
and assume pz /w, © sgn(p-), which is valid for |w-g|Eot >> m, we get a simple expression
for the longitudinal EM current,

This simple estimation is plotted in Fig. jas thin black lines with nonzero constants added
to fit the numerical data. Eq. (14) well reproduces the 6-dependence that the numerical
results show, especially at later times.

In Fig. the coefficient of the linear increase of the current is plotted as a function
of the color angle 6 for various quark mass. As indicated by Eqs. (). this is a periodic
function with a period of 27/3.


Before closing this section, let us emphasize the fact that the knowledge of the Abelian-
ization has not been used in the numerical computations. We have just solved Eqs. (A3),
(A4) and (ATO). Therefore, this numerical calculation can be easily extended to more
complicated gauge field configurations as we will discuss in the next section.

3 Glasma-like electric fields

In the previous section, we have dealt with the uniform electric fields to clarify the physics
of the quark production in classical non-Abelian gauge fields and the difference between
SU(2) and SU(3) color fields for the induction of the EM current. In this section, we study
EM currents induced by more realistic configurations for the background gauge fields.

The gauge fields in the Glasma are uniform in the longitudinal direction reflecting the
00st invariance of the system, and are inhomogeneous in the transverse plane [17]. The
inhomogeneity in the transverse plane is characterized by the saturation scale Q,. One
of the characteristic features of the Glasma is the existence of the longitudinal magnetic
fields. However, the existence of magnetic fields at the initial time is inconsistent with
he assumption of the free initial condition for spinors. In contrast, initial inhomogeneous
electric fields can be given by zero gauge field A(0) = 0, and thus they can be consistent
with the free initial condition for spinors. In the r-71 coordinates, one can construct the
initial condition for the spinors at 7 = 0 that is consistent with the evolution of the gauge
fields describing a collision of color glass condensates [30]. In this case, the existence of
he initial magnetic fields does not cause the inconsistency. However, we cannot employ
hese initial conditions since we assume a system in a non-expanding box. Instead of it, we
employ the gauge fields that initially consist of only electric fields. To mimic the Glasma,
we introduce an ensemble of electric fluxtubes. In the transverse x-y plane, we randomly
distribute Niube = Q?L,Ly-numbers of fluxtubes which has a Gaussian profile with mean
radius 1/Q; and which are uniform in the longitudinal direction:

where €; is transverse coordinates of a center of a fluxtube, which is randomly distributed
in the transverse plane, and ny is a unit color vector whose orientation is random. The
distance |a — €,| is measured in a way respecting the periodic boundary condition. The
electric field trivially satisfies the Gauss’s law (A8).

Figure |4| displays the transverse profiles of the initial energy density of a randomly
generated electric field for SU(2), and SU(3)¢, respectively. Energy density times g?
is plotted since this combination is independent of the value of the coupling g. In the
following, all dimensionful quantities are shown in a dimensionless combination scaled by
powers of Q,. In Fig. [5| the time evolution of the gauge field energy density averaged over
volume is exhibited. Owing to the inhomogeneity in the transverse plane, magnetic fields
are quickly developed, and the equipartition of energy between electric and magnetic
components is realized both for SU(2). and SU(3). case. As observed in Ref. [BT], the
SU(2). and the SU(3), theories show qualitatively similar behavior for the non-Abelian
gauge fields.

Under these classical gauge fields, we have solved the Dirac equation and com-
puted the EM current (Ali). Because the color directions of the background gauge fields
are random in the transverse plane, the space average of the EM current is nearly zero.
In Fig. [6 we plot the space average of the square of the EM current for SU(2), (Left) and

SU(3)- (Right) as a function of time. Unlike the uniform field case, a nonzero current is in-
duced even for SU(2).. However, the current for SU(2). is several orders smaller than that
for SU(3)c. In particular, the longitudinal component is smaller than the transverse ones
in the case of SU(2)¢ although the initial background electric field is along the longitudinal
direction. While the argument of the cancellation of the EM currents between two colors
is strict only for a uniform system, this result indicates that there is still tendency of the
cancellation even in the inhomogeneous system. The nonzero but relatively small current
originates in the violation of the Abelianization argument in nonuniform fields. Hence,
the transverse components are larger than the longitudinal one for SU(2)¢. In contrast,
for SU(3)¢, the cancellation is not perfect even in uniform fields, as shown in the previous
section. Therefore, there is no reason the EM current is suppressed like the SU(2). case.
Indeed, for SU(3)c, the longitudinal current is dominant over the transverse ones. Figure

the current has inhomogeneity whose typical scale is the order of 1/Qs.

Once an EM current is induced, it can emit photons. Photons emitted from a coherent
EM current (nonzero one-point expectation of the EM current operator) form coherent
classical EM fields. This process is simply described by the classical Maxwell equation
coupled to the EM current:

dE

We have numerically solved the lattice version of the Maxwell equation with the EM
current induced by the SU(3)¢ random fields. From the classical EM fields, we can compute
the photon energy spectrum by the following equation:

the photon energy spectrum at the time Qst = 5. As the background color field is
characterized by the scale Qs, the photon energy spectrum has a width determined by the

same scale Qs. In the figure, p,-distribution with fixed p, = 0 and p,-distribution with
fixed pz = 0 are compared. Reflecting the inhomogeneous structure of the background,
the two distributions differ especially at the low momentum region pr S Qs.

4 Summary and discussions

In this paper, we have investigated the induction of electromagnetic (EM) currents as-
sociated with the nonperturbative quark production from classical color fields. In weak
coupling and strong field regimes, which may be realized in the initial stage of heavy-ion
collisions, the quark production in the leading order with respect to the coupling g is
described by the retarded solutions (mode functions) of the Dirac equation under the clas-
sical gauge field. Once the mode functions are obtained, the EM current can be computed
from them. We have numerically solved the Dirac equation on real-time lattice.

To clarify the significant difference between the SU(2)- and the SU(3). theories for
the induction of EM currents, we have considered, at first, uniform and constant color
electric fields as background fields. This field configuration enables us to simplify the

when one studies the induction of EM current and subsequent photon production. Using
he EM current obtained by numerical computations, we further calculated the EM fields

deen computed. Because the background color fields are characterized only by

There are several directions of possible extensions of this study.
While we have dealt with fixed geometry, the systems of relativistic heavy-ion c

induced through the Maxwell equation. From the EM fields, the photon spectrum has

a single

scale @,, the photon spectrum has a width given by the same scale Q,. Reflecting the
random nature of the background color fields, the photon spectrum fluctuates relatively
argely at small momentum region, pr < Qs. We have found that the photon spectrum

‘ollisions

show nearly boost-invariant expansion in the longitudinal beam direction. The boost-
invariantly expanding system can be conveniently described by the 7-7 coordinates. Once
we take account of the expanding geometry, we can utilize the McLerran-Venugopalan
model [38] [39] for the initial condition of the classical background fields instead of the
random fields we introduced by hand. The initial condition for the quark mode functions
which is compatible with the background fields provided by the color glass condensate

framework has been derived in Ref. [30].

It is also interesting and important to go beyond the leading order description in
the coupling g. The next-to-leading order contributions for the quark production can
be computed by adding fluctuations to the initial condition for the classical gauge fields
and considering the back reaction from produced quarks to the background color fields
[29]. If the gauge field fluctuations are involved, the background gauge field is no longer
uniform in any direction. In this case, the numerical cost to solve the Dirac equation

12


becomes unfavorably expensive, and thus we may need to resort to the statistical method
to sample the mode functions.

In this paper, we have considered only one family of quark flavor. Let us comment on
how our results are modified by the inclusion of multi-flavors in the case of the uniform
electric field. In the leading order of the strong field and weak coupling approximation,
quarks with different flavors are produced independently. Therefore, we just need to sum
up the EM currents contributed from each flavor. The quark masses shown in Fig.
m/V/gEo = 0.05,0.65, 2.1, correspond to strange, charm, bottom, respectively, if we as-
sume the field strength is related with the saturation scale as gE) = Q, and take the value
Qs = 2 GeV. Because the line of m//gEo = 0.05 is overlapped by that of m//gEp = 0,
strange and lighter flavors have the same yield. Since the sum of the EM charges of up
(+2e/3), down (—e/3), and strange (—e/3) is zero, the total EM current induced by these
three light flavors is vanishing. As a consequence, there remains only the contribution
from charm quark. Since this argument is based on Eq. (14) which is valid only for the
uniform electric field, consideration of a realistic situation is needed to make a robust

conclusion.
The most important extension of this study would be the computation of a genuine

quantum contribution for photon production. The photon spectrum can be related with
the photon two point function (A,,(x) AL(y)). In the leading order with respect to the
coupling e, there are two kinds of diagrams, shown in Fig. In this paper, we have
computed the classical EM fields by solving the Maxwell equation which couples to the
one-point expectation of the EM current operator, and the photon spectra have been
calculated from the classical EM fields. This classical contribution corresponds to the
disconnected diagram shown in the left of Fig The connected diagram shown in
the right represents a genuine quantum process in a sense that it is related with the
connected two-point current correlation function (Ji, (a) J%(y))c, and it is impossible to
construct it from the classical current (//;(x)). Although the connected contribution
is the same order in the coupling e as the disconnected one, it is not computed in this

paper. It is important to investigate this genuine quantum contribution for the photon

production, in addition to the classical contribution studied in this paper. In particular,
the cancellation between different colors/flavors may not happen in this contribution,
because the two vertexes are connected in the right diagram. However, the computation
of the genuine quantum contribution in the real-time non-equilibrium quantum field theory
involves several problems, which demand further investigation. The present paper provides
a basis for these future investigations.

Appendix A Numerical method

A.1 Lattice discretization

Except a few examples, analytic solutions of the Dirac equation under inhomogeneous
gauge fields are hardly available. Therefore, one needs to resort to numerical methods. In

13


order to numerically solve the classical Yang-Mills equation and the Dirac equation, we
discretize the 3-dimensional space V = Ly x Ly x Lz into N; x N, x N-,-lattice sites. The
space coordinates are labeled by

L = (AgNz, dyNy, AzNz) , (Al)

where nj = 1,2,---,Nj and a; = Li/Nj (i = x,y,z). We assume the periodic boundary
condition. The plane wave is discretized as

. kyn kyn ken
ipa _ . alba yy odie
e = exp {2m (Ae + N, + N, )} ; (A2)
where kj = —% +1,---,-1,0,1,--- an

We take the temporal gauge Aj = 0 and keep the time as a continuum variable. In this
case, the gauge fields are described by link variables U;(x) = exp (iga;Ai(x)) and electric
fields E;(x). The equations of motion for these variables are

OU; (x) = igaiE;(x)U; (2) , (A3)
and

OE; (x) = Ga > 2 {Im [Uj,;(%) + Uj,-;(«)] — (trace)} , (A4)

where U;,;(x) and U;,_;(«) are the plaquettes defined by

Uig (x) = Ui(a)Uj(« + )U} (a + 7)U} (a), (A5)
Uj,-j(#) = Ui(w)U} (w +1 = j)U}(w — j)U;(x — 3), (A6)

and “—(trace)” means
X — (trace) = X — wx -1 (for X € SU(N,)). (A7)

Since derivative appears linearly in the Dirac equation, the derivative for the Dirac
field must be replaced by the center difference to maintain the hermiticity of the theory:

Dy(«) = oe [view +i)- Ul (a —iW(a— i)| . (A9)

Using this covariant difference, we need to solve the Dirac equation for the mode functions,

[ido + iy’ Di - m| WE, o(@) =0, (A10)

as well as the lattice Yang-Mills equations (A3) and (A4). We assume the null initial
condition for the gauge field: U;(to) = 1. Hence the quark mode functions must obey the
free initial condition.

Note that only the negative energy mode functions are necessary to compute such expec-

The numerical cost to compute the mode functions #,,,.-(x) is proportional to (Nz N,N. 2)?
yecause the mode functions depend on both aw and p. To reduce this rather expensive
numerical cost, one can employ a Monte Carlo method [271 [30]. However, in this paper, we
use the deterministic method because we treat gauge fields which are uniform in one direc-
ion at least, of which nature reduces the numerical cost. Under a gauge field uniform in
he z-direction, the z-dependence of the mode functions y

scl) is always e'P:7, There-
ore, the z-dependence need not be computed numerically. The scaling with the lattice
size for the numerical cost to compute the mode functions is modified to (N,Ny)?Nz. A
merit of the deterministic method is that it is free from statistical errors. This is beneficial
especially when one computes local expectations under inhomogeneous backgrounds.

A.2 Treatment of doublers

As is well known, naively discretized fermionic fields suffer from the problem of doublers.
The lattice momentum associated with the center difference

has 2-fold degeneracy. It has two zeros at kj = 0 and k; = N;/2 as Fig [1] shows. In
3-dimensional momentum space, there is 8-fold degeneracy in total. We call the region

the physical region, and the remain the doubler region Agoubler. A way to decouple the
doubler modes from the dynamics is adding the Wilson term to the Dirac equation:

a +t) — W(a r) + U}(@ ive] =0.

(17° + iy'D; m) (x) 4

(A14)

However, we do not employ the Wilson term by the following reason.
Because the Wilson term contains the gauge link, it contributes to the EM current. In
addition to the normal contribution (A11), we have

Jomw = er Ly 7 Im [Frrsel s,c(@)U (2) Up, 5e(@ + i) . (A15)

In the continuum limit, the contribution from the Wilson term vanishes since U(a2)o(2)
is real. However, with a nonzero lattice spacing and under a nontrivial gauge field con-
figuration, this contribution stays nonzero and contaminates the normal contribution. In
particular, for the EM current, the normal contribution may be small or zero due to the
cancellation between different colors as discussed in Sec. |2| and thus the Wilson term con-
tribution can be the same order to the normal contribution. To circumvent this problem,
we employ an alternative way to decouple the doubler modes.

Because we directly handle the mode functions with the specific initial conditions,
we can restrict the momentum p of the mode function 7,,,.(x) to the physical modes,
p © Apnys. By this, the mode functions which have the momentum index p € Agoubler
can be simply excluded from the dynamics. However, the effects of the doubler modes
may not be completely eliminated by this procedure since the mode functions have also
a-dependence. If we Fourier-transform the negative-energy mode functions as

BpseltsP) = yee pal) (A16)

then the momentum p’ spans over the full momentum space Apnys ® Adoubler- There is
still a possibility that the doubler modes contaminate the mode functions through the
a-dependence. At the initial time, the mode functions are proportional to the plane wave
eP® so that wo is diagonal in the momentum space:

Upset = 0,p') x dpp'- (A17)

Because we have restricted the momentum p to the physical modes, also the momentum p’
is in the physical region. In this sense, the effects of doublers are completely eliminated at
the initial time just by the limitation p € Apnys. By the time evolution, the contamination
by the doubler modes may come in. This point becomes apparent if we Fourier-transform
the Dirac equation:

(89°00 — m) Bp, oo(t: P’)

. 3 1 —i(p’i—qi)a; FF ipa; Fyt 7 ! (A18)
+ivey~—y [e 3U;(q) —e O}(-9)| Upselt,p’ -—@) =0,

where U;(q) is the Fourier transform of the link variable. If the gauge field is inhomoge-

neous, U;(q) can carry nonzero momentum and the gauge field may kick out quarks from

the function M evolves in time under the inhomogeneous gauge field introduced in Sec.
Both of the strength and the extent of the inhomogeneity of this gauge field is characterizec
by the scale Q,. As examples, Ue, M(t; Ry, ky; ky, ky) with (kz, ky) = (0,0) and (12,0
are shown. At the initial time Qst = 0, the k’,-distribution is localized at k’, = kz. Since
the inhomogeneous background gauge field carries nonzero transverse momentum, the k/,-
distribution gets broadened by time evolution. However, the extent of the broadening is
an order of Qs, which is a typical momentum the background field carries, and far smaller
than the cutoff momentum. In particular, when k’, is near to the border with the doubler
region (the case of k’, = 12, plotted in the right), the broadening is weaker than the case k’,
is at a low momentum region. As long as we restrict (kx, ky) to the physical region, (k’,, ki)
at the doubler region is not significantly excited. In particular, the zero momentum point
of the doubler (k/, = 24 in this case) is not at all activated. Although we have shown only
two examples of the parameters (kz, ky), the broadening is weak for any value of (Kz, ky),

py s,c(v) to the physical
region, we can suppress the contamination by doubler moded!| This would be not true
if the background field is highly inhomogeneous, or if we continue the time evolution till
a late time. For example, if one reaches thermal equilibrium after a long time evolution,
the physical modes and the doubler modes would be equally excited unless one uses other
method to suppress doublers. However, in the background field and time scale we are
interested in, the contamination by the doublers does not matter.

This method has an advantage in numerical cost. Because we restrict the momentum
p to the physical region, which has the volume of 1/2? of the whole momentum space, the
numerical cost is reduced by factor eight.
