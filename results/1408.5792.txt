Abstract. We perform an analysis of the CMB temperature data taken by the Planck
satellite investigating if there is any significant deviation from cosmological isotropy. We
look for differences in the spectrum between two opposite hemispheres and also for dipolar
modulations. We propose a new way to avoid biases due to partial-sky coverage by producing
a mask symmetrized in antipodal directions, in addition to the standard smoothing procedure.
We also properly take into account both Doppler and aberration effects due to our peculiar
velocity and the anisotropy of the noise, since these effects induce a significant hemispherical
asymmetry. We are thus able to probe scales all the way to £ = 2000. After such treatment we
find no evidence for significant hemispherical anomalies along any of the analyzed directions
i.e. deviations are less than 1.50 when summing over all scales). Although among the larger
scales there are sometimes higher discrepancies, these are always less than 30. We also find
results on a dipolar modulation of the power spectrum. Along the hemispheres aligned with
he most asymmetric direction for 2 < @ < 2000 we find a 3.30 discrepancy when comparing
o simulations. However, if we do not restrict ourselves to Planck’s maximal asymmetry axis,
which can only be known a posteriori, and compare Planck data with the modulation of
simulations along their respective maximal asymmetry directions, the discrepancy goes down
o less than lo (with, again, almost 30 discrepancies in some low-£ modes). We thus conclude
hat no significant power asymmetries seem to be present in the full data set. Interestingly,
without proper removal of Doppler and aberration effects one would find spurious anomalies
at high @, between 30 and 50. Even when considering only ¢ < 600 we find that the boost is
non-negligible and alleviates the discrepancy by roughly half-o.

1 Introduction

The Planck satellite [1] has provided the most accurate determination of the Cosmic Mi-
crowave Background amongst the full-sky experiments. For this reason it can be used not
only for parameter extraction in a given cosmological model but also as a powerful test of
he overall global isotropy of the models. Several papers, already starting a decade ago with
he first public data from WMAP [2], have claimed departures from the global isotropy. For
he particular case of power asymmetries, such as differences in power in two antipodal hemi-
spheres or of a dipolar modulation of the amplitude of the angular power spectrum, these
claims are often at about the 3c level! (see, e.g. [3-12]), especially focusing at large angular
scales, corresponding to multipoles @ < 60 or in some cases € < 600. Since Planck is able to
ook at very small angular scales, corresponding to multipoles up to ~ 2000, it is important
o assess the existence of such anomalies on the full range of scales.

In particular [3] found that in the WMAP first year data on the range of multipoles
£ = 2-40 the power spectrum is higher in one hemisphere than in the opposite one, at 3.00
confidence level, compared with simulations. Later [6] considered the issue of hemispherical
power asymmetry in the three-year WMAP data, finding that a temperature field modulated
by a dipole gives a substantially better fit to the observations than the purely isotropic model:
he best-fit modulation dipole axis points toward (1,b) = (225°,—27°), with an amplitude
of 0.114 and a significance level of 2.60. Then [8, 9] found that the hemispherical power
asymmetry extends to much smaller scales: for the multipole range ¢ = 2 — 600, significantly
more power was found in the hemisphere centered at (J, b) = (226°, 17°) than in the opposite
1zemisphere. A model with an asymmetric distribution of power for = 2 — 600 was found to

etc.; see (4.8) below.


be preferred over the isotropic model at the 2.90 significance level. Interestingly however the
best fit amplitude of the asymmetry was found to be decreasing at high @.

Strikingly in the recent Planck results it was then suggested in [11] (pre-print v1) that the
power asymmetry persists in an even larger multipole range, = 2 — 1500, in the direction
1,b) = (224°,0°). The authors calculated the localised power in discs and introduced a
measure for the asymmetry which is based on the clustering of the directions of maximal
asymmetry in different multipole bins, finding a significant asymmetry at 2.70. However this
claim was questioned in [13] where we have shown in simulations that the analysis has to be
performed in the rest frame of the CMB, since Doppler and aberration effects are giving an
important contribution to hemispherical asymmetries (see also [14]). Such claim has been
questioned also by [15] which performs an analysis similar to the one of the present paper,
although with some important differences that we will stress. Finally in [11] (pre-print v3,
published) the Planck collaboration has reduced the claims of the presence of significant
anomalies to the range € < 600. Given the different treatments in such papers and given
he importance of the issue whether the Universe is violating or not the global isotropy,
it is relevant to assess in an accurate way the presence of anomalies using the method of
estimating the power spectrum on opposite hemispheres, extending our previous analysis [13]
from simulations to the real data.

In this paper we build on the methods developed in [13] to analyze real Planck data.
We focus on the estimation of the power spectrum on opposite hemispheres, with respect
© some special directions. In particular we analyze three different directions: the galactic
North-South direction, the direction of the CMB dipole and the direction (1, b) = (225°, 1°),
which has been claimed by [11] to be the direction of maximal asymmetry, albeit obtained
with different methods. Curiously, this last direction is also not far from the one that was
recently found to maximize a different kind of hemispherical asymmetry, relating not the
amplitude of power but to a variance dipole [16].

Several ingredients are important in order to perform an unbiased analysis of the real
Planck data of the CMB sky in addition to the boost factor analyzed in simulations in our
previous work [13]. First we need to deal with the fact that a mask is applied to the data,
which covers the foreground signals (galaxy and point sources). This is usually taken into
account of by using a mode coupling matrix Myy [17] (the so-called MASTER approach)
which multiplies the power spectrum of the masked sky (Cy, the pseudo power spectrum)
and reconstructs the best estimator for the original full-sky spectrum (C?), and this is done
separately for the northern and southern hemispheres. This procedure has the advantage of
reducing correlations present in the pseudo power spectrum.” However such procedure con-
tains a number of approximations and in order to have a cleaner procedure which is unbiased
by construction we introduce a new and more conservative mask, obtained by symmetrizing
the original Planck one by removing all pixels which are antipodal to the ones which are
originally ignored. In this way we lose some extra fraction of the data, but we have a more
reliable and clean procedure to estimate differences in opposite hemispheres, since by con-
struction the new mask cannot introduce any asymmetry. We also take care of the fact that
when cutting the sky into hemispheres this would introduce a sharp edge, by introducing a
smoothing (or apodization) of the mask on a 10’ angular scale. After applying such mask we
analyze the Ce and apply the matrix My [17] which performs the estimate of the full C;’s.

Such a procedure has been partially applied by [15] by applying a correction for these inter-scale correla-
tions.


Crucially then we take into account of the Doppler and aberration effects, using a mod-
ified version of the HEALPix® package [18] that allows inclusion of these two effects. We
assume that our velocity v compared with the CMB rest frame is given by the CMB dipole
with

B =|v|/e = (1.231 + 0.003) x 1073 (1.1)

in the galactic coordinates
(1, b) = (264°, 48°). (1.2)

Such value and direction is obtained by combining the measured temperatures of the WMAP
dipole [19] with the COBE monopole [20, 21] and it has been also confirmed recently by the
new method of estimating non diagonal correlations in the CMB [22, 23]. Both effects distort
the CMB at all scales and induce a very significant north-south asymmetry [14, 22, 24]. This
was partially taken into account in [15], but they only subtracted Doppler without taking
into account of aberration, which actually is the dominant effect at large @.
Another very important ingredient that we include in our analysis is the experimental
noise, which is not symmetric (see [1]) and which is important at very small angular scales
multipoles > 1300). In this way we are able to perform an analysis which extends to very
righ @.
It is important to note that for very large scale anomalies (¢ < 10), other non-primordial
effects such as the kinetic Doppler quadrupole, the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect and the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect might be relevant [25-28]. Here, however, we do not focus on
he very large scales, and therefore neglect these effects.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the data that we use and the
reatment that we apply to the masks. In section 3 we discuss how to take into account of
Doppler and aberration and of the anisotropic noise. In section 4 we discuss the significance of
1emispherical asymmetries and in sections 5-6 we discuss how to put a constraint on a specific
parametrization of the north-south asymmetries, usually called dipolar modulation. We draw
our conclusions in 7. More specific details are listed in the appendices: in appendix A we
discuss the changes introduced by our symmetrized mask, in appendix B we show how to
build such a mask and finally in appendix C the details of our HEALPix simulations.

2 Data and symmetrized mask

We analyze both data and noise presented by the first release from the Planck collaboration in
the SMICA map which is a CMB temperature map obtained as a multipole-dependent linear
combination of several frequency maps [29]. This combined map has a power spectrum which
is cosmic variance limited up to @ ~ 1700, after which the noise quickly becomes dominant.
n order to minimize possible north-south or dipolar biases induced by the masking
procedure, we suggest a new technique which relies on the following symmetrization of the
mask. Starting from a specific mask, the symmetrized mask is obtained by applying a parity
transformation P :%— —/ on a given pixel at a direction specified by a unit vector *% and
then by multiplying by the original mask. In this way, if a pixel is absent from the original
mask, the corresponding antipodal pixel will also be absent from the new mask. This is a
conceptually clean way of guaranteeing that there will be no parity asymmetry in the final
analysis induced by the mask. In appendix B we discuss how such a mask can be produced
in pixel-space with HEALPix.

Shttp://healpix.sourceforge.net/


We analyze such map with the HEALPix package, with Neiae = 2048 and max = 4000
(further details can be found on Appendix C). We use the U73 mask, which covers the galaxy
and point sources leaving 73% of the sky unmasked. We dub the corresponding symmetrized
mask U73symm, which is shown in Figure 1. In other words, U73symm is the “antipodally
symmetric” version of U73. The downside of the symmetrization is that the leftover area of
the sky is diminished, in this case to 65% .

We then prepare half-sky masks, along the selected directions: North-South with respect
to the galactic plane, with respect to the dipole (1, b) = (264°, 48°) and to the hemispherical
maximal asymmetry direction (1,b) = (225°, 1°), originally obtained in [11]. We obtain this by
rotating the U73symm with a modified HEALPix routine alteralm and cutting half of the sky
with a modified version of the HEALPix routine anafast that allows for asymmetric sky cuts.
These new routines are part of a modification of HEALPix which also allows the inclusion of
Doppler and aberration effects, and which we now dub HEALPix-Boost.*: Crucially in the
final step we also smooth such half-sky masks on a 10’ scale to avoid the presence of sharp

edges, which would otherwise add significant spurious power on small scales and could either
enhance or suppress artificially the presence of North-South (NS) asymmetries. For each of
1ese masks we also obtain the MASTER matrix My, which allows to get an estimator of
1e full-sky C?’s from the masked Cy’s. More details on our HEALPix simulations can be
found in Appendix C.

Since the SMICA data and noise are beamed with a 5’ full-width half-maximum (FWHM)
Gaussian, in order to compare with primordial (unbeamed) simulations, we debeam the Planck
spectrum before making comparisons. On the other hand, Planck SMICA data is deconvolved
from the HEALPix (Ngide = 2048) pixel window function (in other words, they remove it from

1eir data), so we take care also to not include the pixel window function in our simulation

spectra.

3 Dealing with Doppler, aberration and anisotropy in the noise

In order to check the significance of anomalies in the Planck data we need to compare with
simulations and for this purpose we performed 1000 simulations with the HEALPix routine
synfast, using as a fiducial power spectrum the best-fit spectrum for a ACDM model given
by the Planck collaboration [1].

As a next step we need to take into account of the fact that the CMB is measured
in a boosted frame. We perform such transformation using HEALPix-Boost, which allows
introduction of boosts directly on the maps in the Planck data. Specifically before applying
the half-sky masks we apply a boost to all simulations with velocity given by the central
value of Eqs. (1.1)-(1.2). Actually the boost is performed by applying the aberration with
such value and by applying separately the Doppler effect multiplied by a correction factor
(sometimes referred to as boost factor b,) of 2.5. The frequency-dependent boost factor by
arises from the fact that the temperature maps computed by the Planck collaboration do

not exactly represent the map of the thermodynamic temperature (sometimes referred to
simply as CMB temperature). Instead, they are computed from a linear order transformation

“The code has been originally developed and used in [30] to check for biases in power spectrum and
non-Gaussianity [31]. It has also been cross-checked using analytical fitting functions which reproduce the
aberration effects with high precision in [23, 30] and further cross-checked for biases in [13].

Doppler and aberration, are made available at www.if.ufrj.br/~mquartin/cmb



Figure 1. Antipodally-symmetric version of Planck’s U73 mask. The symmetrization is such that
for every masked pixel, the antipodal pixel is also masked. This removes any unaccounted bias on
opposite hemispheres arising from the mask itself. It also slightly reduces the amount fxy of unmasked
sky, lowering it from 0.73 to 0.65. The green and yellow regions separated by the thick orange curve
represent the two hemispheres aligned along Planck’s maximal asymmetry direction, which is one of
the 3 directions analyzed in the present paper. This mask is available online [see text].

which converts intensity into temperature assuming a black-body radiation spectrum. The
resulting map thus no longer transform under boosts exactly as a temperature map would,
and the boost factors are the necessary corrections [up to O(6?)] to the Doppler effect. For
the Planck temperature SMICA map, in which the signal-to-noise is dominated by the 143
GHz (by ~ 2) and 217 GHz (b, ~ 3) channels, a simple estimation is to use the average
by & 2.5, as discussed in [32]. In order to provide a detailed quantitative conclusion on the
significance of the boost, half of these 1000 simulations included a boost, while the other half
were traditional, unboosted simulations.

We then analyze each simulation applying 6 different masks, representing the two hemi-
spheres along each of the 3 directions here investigated. Once this is done we extract the

cl™s) from the North or South map and finally we also compute the CNS), An alterna-
tive procedure, which could constitute a double-check, is to deboost the masked real data
(applying a boost with negative 8, again employing the boost factor of 2.5) and compare
the results with the simulations without any boost. The idea of deboosting the CMB sky in
order to avoid systematic contamination in observables was discussed in detail in [23, 33].°
Since aberration changes the location of all point sources in the sky, it is important to apply
any point source masks before deboosting (or equivalently to use a de-aberrated mask), oth-
erwise foreground contamination would be incorrectly masked. However, when deboosting
the SMICA map some spurious effects are introduced, because the noise and the edges of
the masks also get deboosted, leading to some differences with the procedure of boosting the
simulations. We therefore leave a full study of this possibility for a future analysis.

®Tdeally it should be carried out in the original data before any map-making, but this requires substantial
changes to Planck’s pipeline.


Finally an important issue is the one of the instrumental noise: since the observation
time is not the same in all directions for Planck, there is some intrinsic anisotropy of the
noise which has to be taken into account. One way of doing this is to employ the noise
map for SMICA released by Planck, which is obtained by subtracting two half-ring SMICA
maps, where such maps are simply obtained in the same way as for the SMICA full map, but
considering only half of the observation time. This, however, is not optimal as it is equivalent
0 a single noise Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We therefore made use instead of the 100 MC
noise simulations made available from Planck. Since the Planck collaboration has not released
simulations for the combined SMICA map, we made use instead of the MC simulations for
he 143 and 217 GHz frequencies. These two are then combined multiplying each one by the
SMICA é-dependent weight functions, following [29]. As it can be seen from figure D.2 of
hat paper, the sum of the 143 and 217 GHz channel represent over 95% of the total noise
in the 700 < £ < 2500 range, which covers the whole range of interest here (below £ = 1000
noise is completely irrelevant). We then analyze the noise power spectrum in the different
aalf-sky cuts and add the mean of the MC noise simulations to the CMB results.

To summarize, we have made 500 primordial CMB simulations containing a boost, 500
primordial CMB simulations without boost, and combined these with 100 MC noise simula-
ions for the SMICA combined map made available from the Planck collaboration (although
he Planck team produced 1000 such noise simulations, only 100 of those were made publicly
available).

in Figs. 2 and 3, comparing with mean and standard deviation of the same quantity for the
simulations. Note that for simulations the D,’s contain also the boost effects and the noise
power in each hemisphere. All results are obtained after binning the spectra in 50-@ bins.
Specifically in Figure 2 we show step by step how important is each of the effects that we
consider: smoothing of the mask, boost (Doppler and aberration) and the inclusion of the
anisotropic noise. In both figure we also depict (dashed black curve) the average bias due to
Doppler and Aberration, which is oscillating and has non-zero mean. Such bias was found
in [13] to be extremely well approximated by the analytical expression

which becomes important at such high @.

In Figure 3 we show the final results for the three directions and include also the statisti-
cal significance of the asymmetry summing from ¢ = 2 to different €ax, in order to illustrate
its evolution as we probe ever smaller scales. This significance in turn could in principle be
computed using the fact that the agm’s are Gaussianly distributed, which implies that the
Dy’s are distributed according to a x? distribution. However, we verified numerically that
the binned quantities 6D,/D, themselves are very well described by Gaussian distributions.
Therefore, for i multipole bins we have a simple ? distribution with i degrees of freedom:

where (6D¢/De)sims represents the average over the simulations and OPin is the variance of
(6D¢/De) in a given bin. This variance is a sum of a term arising from cosmic variance and
another from the instrumental noise. For a given Dy, the uncertainty is given by (see [17| or

hemispheres is never beyond a few percent to approximate DN ~ D? ~ D8" ~ D+ NMC,

With the total x? we perform a goodness-of-fit test to see whether the isotropic standard
model is a good fit to the data. Finally, to quote the significance in o levels (instead of p-

values, or probabilities to exceed) using all bins from the first to the i-th bin, one must convert


the probabilities given by
prob = CDF [x?, i] =1- p-value. (4.7)

In what follows we refrain from quoting results in terms of p-values, preferring instead using
the corresponding o-levels, which are defined through the Gaussian distribution:

V2Erf (prob) . (4.8)

Here, Erf—! is the inverse of the error function and CDF is the cumulative distribution
function of the y? distribution with i degrees of freedom:

CDF{z, i] = Thy

(4.9)
where [ and ¥y are the gamma the incomplete gamma function, respectively. In other words,
this is a straightforward generalization of the commonplace association of 1, 2, 30 as short-
hand notation for 68.3%, 95.4%, 99.73%, (independently of whether the underlying distribu-
tion is really Gaussian) and so forth.

As it can be seen from the plots it is crucial to add the anisotropy of the noise and, to a

smaller extent, the boost effects. Taking into account of these two sources of bias makes the
real data compatible with the simulations and in fact there is no highly significant asymmetry
left in any of the three directions. Note that since for 0 < 900 the boost bias is smaller than
the uncertainty, the goodness-of-fit results are never changed by more than lo when boost
effects are included. Nevertheless, a proper account of the boost does reduce the discrepancy
of the maximal asymmetry direction for ¢ € [2, 2000] from 2.50 to 1.30, a very important
result. This possibility was already stressed in [13] on simulations. Note that the boost can
also increase the discrepancy, and in fact that is what happens along the galaxy direction,
where we see a rise in the discrepancy in £ € [2, 2000] from 0.90 to 1.60. This is, however,
still insignificant. So accounting for all directions, the proper accounting of boost does reduce
the worst case discrepancy to less than 20, also non-significant.
The only exception to the above claim can be seen in the very first bin (2 < @ < 50)
along the maximal asymmetry direction. There we see a discrepancy of 3.00. This is in
very good agreement with earlier results, dating back over a decade [3-12]. Note also that
the behaviour of the significance of Figure 3 is in qualitative agreement with the significance
of anomalies found by the Planck collaboration using a very different method (clustering of
preferred directions), as it can be seen comparing with fig.28 of v3 of [11].

5 Results: Dipolar modulation — a posteriori direction

Several previous papers have analyzed a parameterization, in which the CMB temperature is
assumed to be modulated by a dipolar term of the form:

T = Tisotropic (1 + Amoa Cos @) , (5.1)

where a is a relative angle between a specific direction and the direction of observation, which
then translates on the C?’s to lowest order:

Ce = Ce,isotropic(1 + 2Amoa COS @) « (5.2)


Note that such a parametrization corresponds exactly to the physical Doppler effect due to
a boost (but does not contain aberration), where Amoa is equal to the velocity 6. Although
such an ansatz is arbitrary we still provide results on the significance of a nonzero Aymoa,
because several analyses [6, 8, 9, 11] have claimed a detection of a large value for Ayyoa, about
60 times bigger than the Doppler term and with a significance of about 30 when analyzing
the low-¢’s of the CMB, namely up to @ < 64 or ¢ < 600. Of course, if we consider the
above parametrization there is no reason why we should stop at low @’s and the full range of
£ should be used. We repeat this for the two different directions, namely the dipole direction
and the maximal asymmetry direction. Note however that the latter is a specific direction
chosen a posteriori, since it has been already found to be the maximal asymmetry direction
in Planck by other analyses. Therefore the real significance will become lower if considering
the fact that the maximal asymmetry direction should be searched for in each simulation and
marginalized over. In this section we compute the naive significance level, while in the next
section we compute the unbiased significance level by looking for the modulation along the

axis of maximal asymmetry for each simulation.

It is important to note that the data contain a nonzero value for Amoq due to Doppler,
aberration and to the anisotropic noise. Such effects are contained in our simulations, therefore
what we need to constrain is the quantity

Amoa = (Ablanck __ 4sims (5.3)

mod mod *

Given a half-sky cut a modulation such as (5.2) will induce an average effect on the different
ons given by
CN = CO tropic(l + 2Amoa (Cos @)) , (5.4)

by (4.5). The correlations offset these values, but not by much, and we have checked that

Note that this differs from the estimator used in [15] because of the factors (2¢+ 1) included

The results on Amoq are shown in Figures 4 and in Table 1 for different multipole
ranges and assuming two different fiducial modulation directions: (i) (/,b) = (225°,1°),
found in [11] to maximize the hemispherical asymmetry; (ii) the dipole direction. Note
hat (J,b) = (225°,1°) is also very close (actually within the error bars) to the direction
1, b) = (226°, —17°), found in [11] to maximize this dipolar modulation. We split the data in-
ro 3 ranges:  € [2,600], which corresponds to the cosmic-variance-limited region of WMAP,
£ € [601, 1500] which are the extra modes precisely measured by Planck (well within the
cosmic-variance region) and ¢ € [2, 2000], which is the full range of modes accessible (€ = 2000
are clearly dominated by noise). Figure 5 explores further the maximal asymmetry direction
by depicting the measured Amoa using £ € [2, max] as a function of Cmax, together with the
corresponding discrepancy with the fiducial, isotropic model. As it can clearly be seen in
both figures, neglecting the boost makes the data look anomalous at high-¢. When properly
reating the boost we do not find any significant detection for a modulation along the dipole
direction, but there is still some nonzero value along the maximal asymmetry direction, where
for the full range of scales we find Amoq = 0.0044 + 0.0014. Such result has an error and
a central value which is one order of magnitude smaller than the official Planck results [11]
which is limited to scales of about £ < 100, and deviates from zero at the 3.20 level.

The 2 smaller subsets of @’s also allow comparison with previous results in the liter-
ature. For 2 < & < 600 it can be seen from Table 1 that along the maximal asymmetry
direction on these largest scales we find a 2.90 deviation from zero, with a central value of
about Amoa * 0.01 along the maximal asymmetry direction, which is roughly consistent with
previous results [6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 35]. Contrary to what is claimed in [35], however, we find that
even on these large scales the boost effects cannot be completely neglected, and account for
roughly 0.40 of the total discrepancy. For 601 < ¢ < 1500 we can compare directly with [15],
where a strong scale-dependent modulation was invoked. In fact [15] finds that for 0 < 600
there is a 30 anomaly, while for 601 < @ < 2048 there is only a lo deviation, so they claimed
data contained a strong scale dependent modulation. We make here two crucial objections
to such statement. First, as we stressed out, our treatment includes properly many physical
effects which are important especially at high ¢: Doppler, aberration and anisotropic noise,

the best-fit Gaussian for the simulations that neglect the boost. As it can clearly be seen, neglecting
the boost makes the data look anomalous at high-¢. Note that even for ¢ € [2,600] (roughly the
WMAP range), the boost is relevant and alleviates the discrepancy in the maximal direction by
0.40. Note that the values along the maximal asymmetry direction contain an a posteriori bias, since
the direction has been chosen precisely because it maximizes the asymmetry, and therefore the real
significance becomes lower if considering the fact that the maximal asymmetry direction should be
searched for in each simulation. Such an unbiased analysis in depicted in Figure 6.

real Cy’s. This more careful treatment yields a lingering 2.20 deviation on 600 < ¢ < 1500
Amoa = 0.0032 + 0.0015). Second, there is no reason why the data should be split into these
wo arbitrary subsets to constrain the single parameter Ajoa. In fact from Figure 5 we can
conclude using the all data up to 2000 that there is no clear sign of a strong scale dependence
or € = 300. Indeed, the very first bin is the only one in tension, at 2.30, in agreement with
what was found in [11]. However, since for larger scales the variance increases fast, a constant
Amoa is not a bad fit when considering all scales together. So contrary to [11] we find here
no strong reason to claim that a possible modulation must be scale-dependent. However note
hat in the next section, as discussed below, we also find that the significance goes drastically
down when including ¢ > 600.

It is in fact very important to note the following facts. First, as stressed before, the values
along the maximal asymmetry direction contain an a posteriori bias, since the direction has
been chosen precisely because it maximizes the asymmetry, and therefore the real significance
will become lower when considering the fact that the maximal asymmetry direction should be

Figure 5. Similar to Figure 3 for the measurement of Amoa in the range @ € [2, max]. Here the
discrepancy is larger and amounts to 30 when considering all scales (and naively 5c if one neglects

also searched for in each simulation (and marginalized over) to have a statistically meaningful
result. We perform such an analysis in the next section, by using a different estimator, which
finds the modulation along the maximal asymmetry axis.

Second, note also that a detection of non-zero Amoq does not necessarily mean that the
model with dipolar modulation fits better the data, because it has one extra parameter. In
order to assess better this we conduct a Bayesian model comparison by computing the Bayes
Factor B, which is the ratio of Bayesian Evidences (see [36]) of the models with and without
Amod:

where in the modulated model we assumed a flat prior for Amog. Since the evidence is

proportional to the probability that we associate to the correctness of the model, if we in turn
assume these 2 models constitute the complete set of possibilities, then p(M 4) +p(Mo) = 1,
which together with (5.10) allows us to compute both probabilities [36]. We can then ask
by how much is the modulation model favored. It is important to note that while the exact

range of any sufficiently broad priors do not affect any Bayesian parameter estimation, the
same is not correct when doing model selection analysis, such as with the Bayes Factor. In
fact, other things being equal, models with broader priors are disfavored because they are
ess predictive. This is because of the Occam’s Razor factor, which is embedded in the Bayes
Factor (see [37] for a more in-depth discussion). Since we do not want to test specific models

for a dipolar modulation here, we will assume as prior for Amoa the range [—1, 1]. We thus get
for ¢ € [2, 2000] that the modulation model, fixing the direction to be the maximal asymmetry
one, is favored with B = 54, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.18 or equivalently, using (4.8),

0 a 2.40 preference for a modulation.’ As expected, this is less than the naive expectation
trom Table 1 (3.307) because the Bayes factor takes into account the fact that the modulation

model has one free parameter for which we have little information a priori.

Finally note that on the @ < 600 range, which roughly corresponds also to the WMAP
range, the boost is already non-negligible and alleviates the discrepancy from 3.30 to 2.90,
with a central value of Amog shifting down by + 0.002. These numbers, however, cannot be
directly applied to WMAP data because there the average boost factor differs from the one
in Planck.

6 Results: Dipolar modulation — unbiased direction

In the previous section we have assessed the significance of an anomalous dipolar power
modulation of the temperature spectrum along determined directions. Actually however the
direction of maximal asymmetry should not have been pre-determined (i.e., before looking at
the data), and as such constitutes an a posteriori statistic. In order to circumvent this, one
would have to repeat the analysis over hundreds of different directions for each simulation,
finding its maximal asymmetry direction. This is, however, a computationally intensive route.

We thus proceed along a different path which automatically finds the modulation along
the maximal asymmetry direction, by making the crucial observation that a dipolar modula-
tion is completely equivalent to the Doppler effect on a map. We can thus make use of the
peculiar velocity estimators derived in [22] (see eqs. (B7), (B8) and (B15) therein) which give
the cartesian components of a peculiar velocity from a map. Such estimators can be easily

adapted to correspond also to the cartesian estimators of the modulation vector by simply
removing the aberration contribution to the estimator, leaving only the pure Doppler effect.
In practice, this is achieved by using the following slightly modified version of (B8) of [22]:

s s (€+1+m-—s)(€+1—m+s) (€—sm+s?)
Com = (-1)"( ay] (4(€ + 1)? — 1) (1 + 8?) (€+ sm) ;

so d (€+m-—s)(€—m-+s) (€+sm-+1-—s?)
“om (40? — 1) (1 +s?) (€— sm +1) ,

(6.1)

Such an estimator has been derived only in the full-sky case limit and therefore it should be
adapted to the partial sky case. One way would be to try to transform the pseudo-ag,, into

"In Bayesian model comparison the Jeffreys’ scale is often employed, but we find it much more intuitive to
discuss results in terms of g-levels, as one of us first proposed in [38].

Figure 6. Similar to Figure 5 but without the a posteriori selection of the direction of maximal
anisotropy. The discrepancy here is typically below 2c (but over 30 if one neglects boost effects).
The larger discrepancies are at larger scales (¢ € [2,600]), which corresponds to the range of scales
probed by WMAP. Note that here, contrary to the estimator in Figure 5 we do not subtract the noise
asymmetry, which explains the increase of asymmetry on small scales, where the noise dominates.

Qgm’S to use in (B7) of [22], but this would require to compute a MASTER-like tensor with 4

estimator we obtain

an unbiased estimate of the modulation. Therefore we simply used the

Thus we obtain a modulation vector Amod for each map and so we compare the results
for the amplitude |Amoal of the modulation with our simulations. In an isotropic universe
observed by a boosted observer the amplitude of the modulation should converge to a nonzero
value due to the peculiar velocity. The presence of the anisotropic noise, moreover, biases the
result at high @, so it is important to take it into account. We do this by summing the 100

ed noise dg’s made available by the Planck collaboration and summing

hem (with the SMICA weights) to our own simulated temperature ag ,,’s. Once more, we

Figure 6 depicts the modulation amplitude obtained in this way in both cases. Each

of the modulation is Gaussianly distributed, and therefore the magnitude

of the amplitude vector distribution is approximately given by a noncentral chi distribution.
From this distribution we compute the lo bands as well as the significance levels of Figure 6.°
As it is clear from the Figure, removing the a posteriori selection of the maximal asymmetry

diminished discrepancy between simulations and data, and we conclude

hat no significant modulation anomalies are present. The larger discrepancies are at large

, which corresponds to the range of scales probed by WMAP. These

discrepancies however vanish when including smaller scales, unless one mistakenly ignored the
boost. Note that some of the previous analyses have claimed [11, 15] that a scale-dependent
modulation may be necessary to fit the data, in such a way that an effect is present at
£ < 600 but it strongly decays at higher @. We stress here that such a conclusion is only weakly
supported by our results, in the sense that there is no reason to split the data a posteriori into
these two subsets and that our estimator is by construction scale-independent and therefore

SIf we had access to all 1000 MC noise simulations from Planck, we could bypass the need to specify a

the whole range of data should be used. An analysis which includes scale dependence should
be made with a different ansatz for the modulation, which hopefully should be physically
motivated and with the least amount of extra parameters.

Note again that, as in the previous section, the boost is already non-negligible and
alleviates the discrepancy by about half o even at ¢ < 600, which correspond to the WMAP
scales of interest.

7 Conclusions

We have analyzed the CMB Temperature map released by Planck, the SMICA map, which is
a linear weighted combination of different frequency maps and looked for differences in power
spectra on opposite hemispheres along some special directions: North South compared to
the galactic plane, along the dipole direction and along the direction of maximal asymmetry
(1, b) = (225°, 1°) found by Planck [11] (which is also close to the WMAP maximal asymmetry
direction [3, 6, 8, 11]).

We used a new technique to analyze anomalies by first building an antipodally sym-
metrized version of the U73 mask, which by construction cannot introduce a bias on hemi-
spherical asymmetries, and then smoothed the resulting mask on a 10’ scale. We have thus
reconstructed the real Cy’s using the MASTER approach and compared the real data with
simulations. We properly added both Doppler and aberration effects due to the peculiar
motion of the observer using the methods developed in our previous work performed on simu-
lations [13] using them now on real data. We also added the anisotropic Planck noise. We find
three main results, improving on previous analyses [15] in several ways: with the symmetrized
mask, the reconstruction of C2’s from the Cys, the inclusion of aberration and anisotropic
noise and also by using a new estimator which finds the maximal asymmetry direction for
each simulation.

First, all such effects are important, and after subtraction of the above effects we find
that hemispherical anomalies are less significant than 1.50 the full range of @, up to 2000.

Second, we find results on a scale-independent “dipolar modulation” Amoq of the power
spectrum, by introducing a proper estimator, which differs by the one used in [15] and takes
into account of the boost and of anisotropic noise. Pre-selecting the maximal asymmetry
direction (which was previously found by the Planck collaboration and it is consistent also
with the maximal asymmetry direction of WMAP) we find Amoq = 0.0044 + 0.0014 for the
full range of 2 < @ < 2000, which would constitute a 3.30 anomaly when we compare to Amoa
of simulations. Note that such value contrasts with the low-é results [3, 6, 8] including the
Planck analysis [11], which have both central value and error larger by an order of magnitude.
However this 3.30 result is an overestimate of the real statistical significance, when comparing
with the modulation for simulations along a generic direction, while the selected direction for
1e Planck data was not randomly chosen. A better statistics which does not suffer from this
bias is built by using an estimator which finds directly the amplitude of the modulation along
1e maximal asymmetry axis for each simulation. This is achieved by using three estimators
which correspond to the cartesian components of a modulation vector Amod: With this
unbiased procedure we find that the real statistical significance in the range of 2 < ¢ < 2000
is less than lo, and it is only 2.40, in the WMAP-equivalent range of 2 < @ < 600. Note
1at the presence of a marginally significant modulation when considering £ < 600 scales and
1e absence of a modulation when including smaller scales may lead to the idea that it could
be necessary to fit the data with a scale-dependent modulation. We stress here that such a

Figure 7. Corrections from symmetrizing the mask and applying the MASTER approach for the case
of the hemispheres aligned with the galactic plane. The brown curve and green regions are the same as
in Figure 2. The dashed red curve and gray band stand for the same but without using the MASTER
approach. We find that although the symmetrization of the mask removes the bias from the C,’s (i.e.,
prior to the MASTER correction), the difference becomes very small for the reconstructed C/’s (i.e.,
after the MASTER correction). Computing the MASTER matrix is nevertheless time-consuming and
its inverse become numerically unstable to compute unless one bins the multipoles. Therefore, using
a symmetric mask might be more practical in some applications.

conclusion is only weakly supported by our findings since we have no justification to split the
data a posteriori into these two subsets for our scale-independent estimators, and therefore
the whole range of & should be used. An analysis which includes scale dependence should
be made with a different estimator, either because of a physically motivated reason or by
showing that it improves the fit even at the expense of extra parameters.

Third, we stress that ignoring the effect of a boost would lead to a spurious significance
of hemispherical anomalies at almost 30 in the full range of ¢’s and an artificially enhanced
nonzero result for Amoa, which would reach roughly the 3.50 level (and the 5¢ level without
removing the above mentioned a posteriori bias). As a last remark note also that a boost
affects not only temperature maps but also polarization ones. Therefore future analysis of
power asymmetries, for either temperature or polarization, should always take both Doppler
and aberration effects into account.

A Comparison of original and symmetrized masks

In Figure 7 we illustrate the corrections introduced by symmetrizing the mask and employing
the MASTER approach. As it can be seen, the non-symmetric U73 mask introduces a bias
to the pseudo Des. This bias is removed through the use of the MASTER matrix, in which
case the end results are similar (but not identical) to the ones obtained using the symmetric

17


U73symm mask. We conclude that the symmetrization of the mask introduces a small but
not completely negligible correction. Since by construction it cancels any bias arising from
leakage of mask power into the final result, we find it to be the safest approach.

It is interesting to note that for the complete masked sky, the use of a antipodally
symmetric mask removes all first neighbors (¢, + 1) correlations. This is however no longer
true if we analyse individual hemispheres.

Another advantage of a symmetric mask arises in cases where multipole binning of the
spectra is either undesirable or impractical, for instance when computing asymmetries in
narrow £ ranges. This is because the MASTER matrix become numerically unstable to invert
unless one bins the multipoles. In those cases, using a symmetric mask as a safeguard could
be even more important.

B_ Constructing a symmetrized masks

In order to construct a symmetric mask from a non-symmetric mask we work on pixel-space
assuming the original mask is ordered according to HEALPix’s RING ordering scheme. The
simplest way to symmetrize the mask is to reorder the pixel indexing of the original mask to
construct a parity-inverse mask and then multiply both masks.

This reordering can be achieved by setting each pixel angles {6,¢} > {x — 0,64 7}.
With these transformations “polar” pixels remain “polar” and likewise for “equatorial” pixels,
so we can treat each region separately. Based on Eqs. (2)—(9) of [18], we define:

Ppotar(ts3) = 2G—-1i+j-1, (B.1)
Dequat (4, J) = Pholar(Neides 0) + Ai _ Ngide) Neide +9; (B.2)
Peotar (ts j= Pequat (3.Nside + 1,0) — 2(i — 5Neiae)(é — 1 — 3Noide) +3, (B.3)
jmax(i) = 4%, (B.4)
rue = 4Nsgide - (B.5)
(B.6)
We then construct 2 lists, for the polar and equatorial strips:
For i= 1 to Neiae—1
For j = 1 to j¥,,(i) (B.7)
. : a . ., lin », _N /.
list: {Pani Photar (4Noite ~ é, 1 + Mod(j + 5 Jinx) 1. Fat®))) }
and
For i = Ngiae to 2Neide
For j = 1 to jeauat (B.8)

1
list2 : {Pua (i,9), Pequat (4Nsiae — i,1+ Mod (i + gJmax — 1 Jue’) ) \ :

Each list element is a pair of indices of antipodal pixels. The last 2Nsiqe terms of list2 are
redundant, so we define a list3 by dropping these terms from list2. Finally, we construct one
single list4 by the juxtaposition of listl and list3. This final list represents the sought out
indices pairings. By reordering the original mask pixels according to this list one gets an
antipodal mask.

C. Details of our HEALPix simulations

In all our simulations we employ the following HEALPix parameters: nside = 2048; nlmax =
4000 (except for creating the masks, in which case we used nlmax = 5000); iter_order = 1;
regression = 0; won = 1; iseed 1,..., —500. For Planck data and noise, we instead used
iter_order = 3. We also do not apply the pixel window functions. Our modified HEALPix
allows the inclusion of boost effect in the synfast routine. This is controlled through two new
flags: “ab_dopp” (0 for no boost, 1 for Doppler only, 2 for Doppler and aberration) and “beta”
(the boost velocity). In order to employ a boost factor of 2.5, we apply 2 consecutive boosts,
one with ab_dopp = 2 and beta = 0.00123, and the other with ab_dopp = 1 and beta =
0.001845. Finally, to deboost the SMICA map, we used the same procedure but inverting the
sign of beta, taking care first to: (i) debeam the data, (ii) mask the sky (to avoid missing the
foregrounds due to aberration) and (iii) remove the noise (which is added back at the end,
avoiding a deboosting of the noise).
